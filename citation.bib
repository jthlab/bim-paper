    abstract = "{Neutrality tests such as Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989) and Fay and Wu’s H (Fay and Wu 2000) are standard implements in the population genetics toolbox. One of their most common uses is to scan the genome for signals of natural selection. However, it is well understood that D and H are confounded by other evolutionary forces—in particular, population expansion—that may be unrelated to selection. Because they are not model-based, it is not clear how to deconfound these tests in a principled way. In this paper we derive new likelihood-based methods for detecting natural selection, which are robust to fluctuations in effective population size. At the core of our method is a novel probabilistic model of tree imbalance, which generalizes Kingman’s coalescent to allow certain aberrant tree topologies to arise more frequently than is expected under neutrality. We derive a frequency spectrum-based estimator which can be used in place of D, and also extend to the case where genealogies are first estimated. We benchmark our methods on real and simulated data, and provide an open source software implementation.}",
